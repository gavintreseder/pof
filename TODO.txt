Joshâ€™s Graph
Add condition
Add Inspection Interval into interface
Add starting condition
Load with pole failure modes


    # TODO make layout into a class 

    # Add Load methods
        # Load asset Model
        # Load asset data

    # Add condition graph -> Fix this later
    # Add Inspection Interval
        # Generalise to sesnistity
    # Add drop down asset id
        # Asset in poor health




# TODO later
    # Fix error when failure mode is set to inactive tasks are not being executed
    # move condition from failure mode to component and use pf_interval to create a condition_loss class
    # Sort out the boundary between failure mode and condition

    # connect system impact for failure modes
    # Add Condition Graph
    # Add PoF
    # Add task table
    # Share condition

    # Investigate why the change to condition made everything slower




# Improvements

    # Move to celery and redis

    # Add a method when you don't want to use condition, only failure rates
    # Get 'step' condition working


# Get multiple failure modes working

    # Add functionality to reset failure modes
        # Task -> CM definitely
            # Component -> Which failure_modes reset the component

    # Add safety factor

    # Add method to replace on failure?

# Get example assets working

    # Load a pole asset

    # Load indiciative pole details

# Make the interface prettier

# Sensitivity Analysis

    # Input to change
    # Min
    # Max
    # n_steps

    # Output Graph type / axis

    #Graph
        # Fix axis


# Story

    # Failure rate for whole population
    # Failure modes
    # Failure modes with reset
    # Failure modes with condition






    # Dash ID
        type-name

    # collapse id
        type-name-collapse

    #dash-update

        type-name

        Check type and name match
        strip and then match
