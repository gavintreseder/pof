    # Nice to have
        # Interface improvements
            # Condition
            # PoF
            # Task Schedule
            # Cost forecast

            # Generalise to sensitivity




Add condition
Add Inspection Interval into interface
Add starting condition
Load with pole failure modes


# TODO later
    # move condition from failure mode to component and use pf_interval to create a condition_loss class
    # Sort out the boundary between failure mode and condition

    # connect system impact for failure modes

    # Investigate why the change to condition made everything slower
        # Move condition to component
        # load using condition loss
        # simplify calcs

# Improvements

    # Move to celery and redis
    # Add a method when you don't want to use condition, only failure rates
    # Get 'step' condition working


# Get multiple failure modes working

    # Add functionality to reset failure modes
        # Task -> CM definitely
            # Component -> Which failure_modes reset the component

    # Add safety factor

    # Add method to replace on failure?

# Get example assets working

    # Load a pole asset

    # Load indiciative pole details

# Make the interface prettier

# Sensitivity Analysis

    # Input to change
    # Min
    # Max
    # n_steps

    # Output Graph type / axis

    #Graph
        # Fix axis


# Story

    # Failure rate for whole population
    # Failure modes
    # Failure modes with reset
    # Failure modes with condition



Condition -> object
termites - 3 years
decay - 10 years
weathering = 50 years

ConditionLoss -> Failure Mode
