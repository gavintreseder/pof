# Improvements

    # Add a method when you don't want to use condition, only failure rates

# Add graphs

    # Expected condition over time
    # Expected uncertainity over time

# Get multiple failure modes working

    # Add functionality to reset failure modes
        # Task -> CM definitely
            # Component -> Which failure_modes reset the component

    # Add safety factor

    # Add method to replace on failure?

# Get example assets working

    # Load a pole asset

    # Load indiciative pole details

# Make the interface prettier

# Sensitivity Analysis

    # Input to change
    # Min
    # Max
    # n_steps

    # Output Graph type / axis

    #Graph
        # Fix axis


# Story

    # Failure rate for whole population
    # Failure modes
    # Failure modes with reset
    # Failure modes with condition
