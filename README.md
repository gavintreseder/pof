### Setup
To download, view and execute the code base you will need:
- Python: The easiest way to setup python is through anaconda. https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual 
- Visual Studio Code: The IDE for navigating and executing the code. https://code.visualstudio.com/download 
- Git: An application for downloading the current repository from GitHub. https://git-scm.com/downloads 

The setup process to run the application on an Essential Energy computer requires a software request for:
1. Anaconda
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Git

### Installation
To access the development code base the following steps are requried:
1. Clone the repository
2. 
#### Clone Repo

https://github.com/gavintreseder/pof

#### Select Interpreter
ctrl + shift + p

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments 


#### Setup a virtual environment
##### Execution only
Python applications 
Create a new virtual environment so that previous python installations work
>>> virtualenv .venv -p python3.9

Activate the venv or launch a new terminal. You will know this has worked if you have (.venv) in front of your path in the terminal
>>> /.venv/bin/activate

Upgrade pip to the latest version to make sure packages install correctly

>>> python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Install the dependencies that are for this module to run

>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

##### Optional steps for development
Install the dependencies that are required to develop this module

>>> pip install poetry
>>> poetry install

In some instances notebooks may not detect the venv and may need to be linked the ipykernel. If the unittests are passing, but executing the notebooks raise ModuleNotFoundError then this is the likely cause

>>> ipython kernel install --user --name=.venv
