https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments 


#### Setup a virtual environment
Create a new virtual environment so that previous python installations work
>>> virtualenv .venv -p python3.9

Activate the venv or launch a new terminal. You will know this has worked if you have (.venv) in front of your path in the terminal
>>> ./venv/bin/activate

Upgrade pip to make sure everything installs correctly

>>> python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Install the dependencies that are for this module to run

>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

Install the dependencies that are required to develop this module

>>> pip install poetry
>>> poetry install

If using notebooks are not detecting the venv you have set up you may need to link the ipykernel. The symptom to observe is that unittests pass, but the notebooks raise ModuleNotFoundError for dependencies that have been 

>>> ipython kernel install --user --name=.venv
